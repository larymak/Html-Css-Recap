# CSS Typography

In this activity, you'll be modifying CSS properties to style your text in different ways.

## Instructions

- Using the `html-template` file provided to you, create an external CSS stylesheet to modify the typography of each of the body paragraphs.

- Be sure to modify the following CSS properties for each paragraph of your page:

  - font-family

  - font-size

  - font-weight

  - line-height

- Hint: You will need to do three things to accomplish this task.

  - Link to a CSS page that you'll make

  - Create classes for each paragraph

  - Add in styles for each class

## Bonus

- If you finish early, read about [TypePlate - http://typeplate.com/](http://typeplate.com/) and see if you can figure out how to incorporate it into your site.

- If you still finish early, spend some time trying to actually make the page look nice. Think about what's aesthetically pleasing and push yourself to create it.
