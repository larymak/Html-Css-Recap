# Don't be a floater

- Introduce yourself to 1–2 people next to you.

- Then using `floats.html` and `floats.css` as a starting point, work together to create the missing CSS necessary to form the layout shown to you on screen.

- This will not be easy so work at it as best you can. This is a challenging activity. At the very least, try to increase your understanding of CSS properties.

- Hint: Concentrate on first figuring out how to create the boxes. Think about using background colors (CSS property: `background`).

- Hint: We've provided the styling you need for the header element. Use this as a starting point to style the others.

- Hint: You will need to apply each of the following CSS properties at least once:

  - padding

  - margin

  - background

  - float

  - width (read up on width by percents)

  - color

  - clear

  - overflow

  - height

  - font-size

  - line-height
